# Decoding_Neural_Architecture
Key Highlights:

1) Neuron Design: Designed individual neurons in each layer, complete with their own weights and biases.

2) Activation Functions: I've implemented activation functions like the sigmoid function to introduce non-linearity and enable complex pattern recognition.

3) Forward Propagation: I've programmed the network to perform forward propagation, which means feeding data through the network layer by layer, applying weights and biases, and calculating the final output.
